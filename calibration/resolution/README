# This is a prototype to extract TOF resolution
# The idea is to calculate (t-texp)_study - (t-texp)_ref for two particles in the same event
# ref -> is defined in a strict kinematic reagion (0.6 < p < 0.7 GeV, Chi2 < 5, ITS-TPC tracks)
# study can be any selection
# by fixing study = ref (same kinematic region) is possible to extract sigma_ref*sqrt{2}
# by fitting any other region is possible to measure sqrt{sigma_study*sigma_study + sigma_ref*sigma_ref}
# once sigma_ref is known (first step) it is possible to derive sigma_study for any kinematic region

# HOW TO RUN

# in same cases (some storage not avialable) it could be useful to set the preferite site in this way
#export ALIEN_SITE=GSI


# create a list of AOD to be procecessed locally (access via xrootd/alien)
# for example
alien.py find /alice/data/2022/LHC22m/523897/apass2 AO2D.root|awk '{print "alien://"$1}' >lista

# lunch local processing (token is needed)
# for example (it runs over the full list)
cat -b lista |awk '{print "./process.sh",$1,$2}' | bash

# merge results (it can be done at any intermediate stage)
ls tree_* >listaM
root -b -q -l DoMerge.C
# -> full.root

# resolution for 1.4 < pT < 1.5 GeV/c (macro tuned in this range)
root res.C

# resolution for 1.8 < pT < 2.0 GeV/c (macro tuned in this range)
root res2.C

# check dependence vs p/m and eta
# Note that the resoltution of the reference particles is hardcoded, sigmaRef (fix it at the proper value, e.g. the one provided by previous macros)
root makeplot.C
